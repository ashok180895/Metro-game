# Metro-game

A tile placement game called [*Metro*](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/metro/game-rules.php),
made by games developer Dirk Henn and published by [Queen Games](https://ssl.queen-games.com/en/start_en/). 
[Board Game Geek provides a description of Metro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/559/metro), including images of the components. The game is implemented in Java and JavaFX

### Rules

Metro is a game for 2-6 players, who take turns placing tiles.
First, the deck is shuffled so that the tiles are drawn in a random order.
Each player starts with an empty hand.

On their turn, a player draws a tile (if they do not currently have one in their hand), then they place the tile on the board.
If they do not wish to place the tile, they may pick up another tile from the deck *which they must place immediately*.
On their following turn, they have the option to place the tile in their hand, or again draw from the deck. 
On any given turn, if a player chooses to draw from the deck when they *already have a tile in their hand*,
they *must place the tile that they draw*.

There are four conditions that must be followed when laying down tiles:

* Each tile must be placed on a square adjacent to another tile or the edge of the board.
  A tile may not be placed next to one of the central station tiles unless it is also adjacent to another tile.
* Tiles cannot be rotated.
* A tile may be placed against any other player's metro line or station. 
* A tile may not be placed so that it connects two stations (or loops back to the same station) with a track of length 1, unless there is no other valid way to place this tile (this rarely occurs). 

The game ends when all tiles have been placed.
The winner is decided by scoring completed tracks 




### Board

Tiles are placed on a board of 8x8 squares, labelled 0-7 across the rows and columns.
Each square is labelled `(row, column)` or equivalently `(y,x)`.
Around the edges of the board are *stations*, which are numbered 1 to 32 starting in the top right corner and continuing anticlockwise.
Which edge stations belong to each player depends on the number of players in the game; the station arrangements for 2-6 players
are as follows:

- 2 players:
  - player 1 owns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31
  - player 2 owns 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32
- 3 players:
  - player 1 owns 1, 4, 6, 11, 15, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31
  - player 2 owns 2, 7, 9, 12, 14, 19, 22, 27, 29, 32
  - player 3 owns 3, 5, 8, 10, 13, 18, 21, 24, 26, 30
- 4 players:
  - player 1 owns 4, 7, 11, 16, 20, 23, 27, 32
  - player 2 owns 3, 8, 12, 15, 19, 24, 28, 31
  - player 3 owns 1, 6, 10, 13, 18, 21, 25, 30
  - player 4 owns 2, 5,  9, 14, 17, 22, 26, 29
- 5 players:
  - player 1 owns 1, 5, 10, 14, 22, 28
  - player 2 owns 6, 12, 18, 23, 27, 32
  - player 3 owns 3, 7, 15, 19, 25, 29
  - player 4 owns 2, 9, 13, 21, 26, 30
  - player 5 owns 4, 8, 11, 20, 24, 31
- 6 players:
  - player 1 owns 1, 5, 10, 19, 27
  - player 2 owns 2, 11, 18, 25, 29
  - player 3 owns 4, 8, 14, 21, 26
  - player 4 owns 6, 15, 20, 24, 31
  - player 5 owns 3, 9, 13, 23, 30
  - player 6 owns 7, 12, 22, 28, 32

There are also four stations located in the centre of the board at coordinates `(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)`.
These belong to no player, but double the score of any line that ends at them.


### Tiles

Tiles have 8 exits, starting with 0 in the top-left corner and continuing clockwise as shown below.
Each even-numbered exit connects to an odd-numbered exit.



Every tile is represented by a four-character string. 
Each character is a letter between 'a' and 'd', denoting the **orientation of the
tracks leading from even-numbered exits on each side of the tile**, starting at exit 0 and moving clockwise.
More specifically,

* 'a' denotes a straight track;
* 'b' denotes a track that turns 90?? to the neighbouring edge clockwise;
* 'c' denotes a track that turns 90?? to the neighbouring edge counter-clockwise; and,
* 'd' denotes a track that turns 180?? i.e. loops back to the same edge.


There are 60 tiles in total, with 2-4 copies of each tile as follows: 
* **4 copies** of tiles `aacb`, `cbaa`, `acba`, `baac`, and `aaaa`;
* **3 copies** of tiles `cbcb` and `bcbc`; and,
* **2 copies** of all remaining tiles: `cccc`, `bbbb`, `dacc`, `cdac`, `ccda`, `accd`, `dbba`, `adbb`, `badb`, `bbad`, `ddbc`, `cddb`, `bcdd`, `dbcd`, `adad`, `dada` and `dddd`.

Individual images of each tile can be found in `src/gui/assets`.

### Tile Placements

A *tile placement* string is a six character string, the first four characters of which represent a [tile](#tiles).
The final two characters are digits between 0 and 7 denoting the row and column of the tile (in that order).
For example, the tile `cccc` in row 3, column 2 would be labelled `cccc32`. 

A *placement sequence* string is a concatenation of up to 60 tile placement strings, representing all tiles that have been placed so far in a game.

### Scoring


Any metro lines that start at a player's station and end at a station score points. 
A player scores 1 point *for each tile the metro line crosses.* If a metro line crosses a tile *more than once*, then the player
scores 1 point for *every time that line crosses the tile.* If a line ends at one of the central stations,
the points for that line are doubled.
